So I've never been to Hawaii before and I am as excited to go as I am worried about the weather. San Diego, where I'm from, doasn't get a lot of rain, and when we do it washes away everyones ability to drive. You would think the roads were covered in ice and everyones tires were as bald as Sir Patrick Stewart. <img align="right" src="picard.jpg" width="150"> Well I watched a lot, and I mean A LOT, of Star Trek:TNG, and some of that shows' science wore off on me. Now I can't just say "Computer" (sounds like "Com-pew-ta") and have the ship tell me the answer to whatever I ask (AI goals for Hey Alexa) like they do on the Enterprise...

...But I can use my analytics skills and get some data for my upcoming trip. With the magic of SQLAlchemy I can turn a few keystrokes into the information I need. By pulling the data from 9 of the most active weather collecting stations on Hawaii I was able to graph the precipitation levels for the entire year preceding the day of my trip. 

And the fun doasn't end there. I also created an image to help me see the temperatures captured by the most active of those stations.

Finally I wanted to see what the average temperature would be for my trip. What's easier than saying "Okay Google", typing plt that's what. Without much further ado here is that visual. <img align="right" src="Trip_Avg_Temp.png" width="150"> So it looks like lots of rain and hot weather awaits me in paradise. Well looks like I might be better off staying in my hotel room, calling up some room service, and hanging out with my fav character Data. <img align="bottom" src="tng-data.jpg" width="200">
